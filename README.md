# virtual-painter

Required packages: OpenCV, Mediapipe, Numpy.

## Steps
1. download the repo.
2. Create a virtual environment for your project, so you don't mess up with the other project's dependencies.

```
python3 -m virtualenv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate
```

3. Install the packages straight or via requirements.txt where you define a list of dependencies.

```
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. run the main module.
